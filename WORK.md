# Work Progress

## Project Complete! 🎉 (2025-01-29)

### Final Session - Reached 100% ✅

#### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite:
  - `test_models.py` - 26 unit tests for domain models
  - `test_transforms.py` - 9 unit tests for transform engine  
  - `test_serialization.py` - 18 unit tests for loaders/savers
  - `test_cli.py` - 14 integration tests for CLI commands
  - **Total: 67 tests, all passing, 63% code coverage**

- ✅ Enhanced version support:
  - Added detection for legacy versions (v1.0, v2.0, v3.0)
  - Improved error messages for unsupported formats
  - Graceful handling of missing fields
  - Better validation warnings

- ✅ Code quality improvements:
  - Fixed all linting issues with ruff
  - Consistent code formatting
  - Updated test to match new validation logic

### What Was Achieved

The tscprojpy package is now production-ready with:

1. **Two fully functional commands:**
   - `xyscale` - Scales spatial properties (canvas, positions, sizes)
   - `timescale` - Scales temporal properties (preserves audio duration!)

2. **Robust architecture:**
   - Domain-driven design with immutable models
   - Transform engine with visitor pattern
   - Serialization layer with version detection
   - Media factory supporting all types

3. **Quality assurance:**
   - 67 comprehensive tests
   - 63% code coverage
   - All linting checks pass
   - Error handling and validation

4. **Professional features:**
   - Rich CLI with progress indicators
   - Verbose logging with loguru
   - Auto-generated output filenames
   - Type hints throughout

### Version Support
- ✅ Camtasia 2021+ (v9.0) - Full support
- ✅ Camtasia 2020 (v4.0) - Full support  
- ⚠️ Camtasia 2019 (v3.0) - Detected with warning
- ⚠️ Camtasia 2018 (v2.0) - Detected with warning
- ⚠️ Earlier versions - Detected with warning

### Testing Results
