# Work Progress

## Current Session

### Completed
- ✓ Analyzed project structure and requirements
- ✓ Studied the .tscproj JSON format extensively  
- ✓ Created detailed PLAN.md and TODO.md files
- ✓ Implemented core scaler.py module with comprehensive scaling logic
- ✓ Updated cli.py to add the xyscale command with rich output
- ✓ Added loguru dependency for logging
- ✓ Successfully tested with example file (150% and 50% scaling)
- ✓ Fixed all linting issues and formatted code
- ✓ Created CHANGELOG.md to document changes

### What Was Implemented
The `xyscale` command now fully works and scales:
- Canvas dimensions (width/height)
- All object positions and sizes
- Rectangle arrays (rect, trackRect)  
- Callout definitions
- Keyframe animation values
- Default dimension metadata

The implementation includes:
- Auto-generated output filenames (e.g., file_150pct.tscproj)
- Rich terminal UI with progress indicators
- Verbose logging mode for debugging
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type hints throughout

### Next Steps
- Create unit tests for the scaler module
- Create integration tests for the CLI
- Update README.md with usage examples
- Consider adding more features like selective scaling
